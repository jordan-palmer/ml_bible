In this repo, I hope to generate ML models to classify the famous MNIST dataset. This has been done many times before but I wish to implement many different techniques (CNN, GAN, Autoencoder,...) where each are optimised and validated to the max

Note: this is the first time I am attempting to write some of these ML techniques (which is why im attempting them!)
